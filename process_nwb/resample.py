    Operates along the last dimension of the array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : ndarray, (n_time, ...)
        Signal to resample.
    up : float
        Factor to upsample by.
    down : float
        Factor to downsample by.
    npad : int
        Padding to add to beginning and end of timeseries.
    pad : str
        Type of padding. The default is ``'reflect_limited'``.

    Returns
    -------
    y : array
        The x array resampled.

    Notes
    -----
    This uses edge padding to improve scipy.signal.resample's resampling method,
